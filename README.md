# ReadME
This is my personal portfolio for my role as a software engineer, and also for my role as an artist. The dichotomy of these two positions in my life has created the person that I am. I hope you enjoy the process of my portfolio creation as documented below.

## Planning
This started out as a completely different file of which I have since gotten rid of (something you really shouldn't do in the coding world). I started creating my portfolio, not realizing how much I preferred React, and as I continued to work on the previous version, I started to despise it (just a little). For me, React is a lot more intuitive and much more fun to use. As such, I have started this file and have had a lot more fun planning it out.
